    <h2> Our Leader Jurgen Klopp </h2>
    <img style="float:left;" width=30% height 250px src="klopp-1.jpg" alt="persons face"/>
    <p> Jurgen Klopp is the manager of Liverpool FC. He has rejuvenated the club into one of the powerhouses of world soccer after lifting the Champions League and the Premier League during his tenure at Anfield.
  The Stuttgart-born manager began his coaching career at Mainz 05, the club where he had played the majority of his soccer as a striker and defender. In 2008, after seven years with Mainz, he joined Borussia Dortmund on a two-and-a-half-year deal.
    At Signal Iduna Park, Klopp transformed the Black and Yellows and guided Dortmund to back-to-back Bundesliga titles and a UEFA Champions League final.
      After another seven-year spell, this time with Dortmund, Klopp joined Liverpool in 2015 and moulded the Reds into an elite outfit again. The Champions League was added to the Reds' trophy cabinet in 2019 before a Premier League title came Liverpool's way in 2020 - the Reds' first league title for 30 years. </p>
